# Laravel Violations 1.0.0 - 2025-11-24
* Added support for `csp-hash` and `permissions-policy-violation` reports, though csp-hash reports are only supported when using CSP3 `report-to` endpoints.

## Laravel Violations 0.1.0 - 2025-06-07
* The first release of a Laravel package to help you set up client-side reporting endpoint headers, and to handle the reports that they send in your app.

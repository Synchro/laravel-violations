     * 1. Set your desired prefix in this config
     * 2. Call Route::violations() without parameters (recommended)
     * 3. Routes will be registered with this prefix automatically
     *
     * Examples:
     * - 'route_prefix' => 'violations' → Route::violations() → /violations/csp, /violations/reports
     * - 'route_prefix' => 'security-reports' → Route::violations() → /security-reports/csp, /security-reports/reports

     * Note: You can still override by passing a parameter: Route::violations('custom-name')
